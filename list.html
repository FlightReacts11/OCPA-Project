    <p class="ant">Anthony Edwards is one of the most athletic players in the NBA. He's able to effectively get into the paint and gets highlight dunks every night on top of being an above average 3pt shooter shooting 
    35% from 3 last year and over <span class="p1">45% from 3 this year</span>. He's the number one option on a championship contending team and finished 7th in MVP voting last year

        <p class="steph">At 36 years old Steph Curry is still the best volume 3pt shooter in the league and arguably just the best shooter in the league with a fg% of <span class="p2"> 47% </span> and a 3pt% of <span class="p2-1">43% this year</span>. At the time or writing this the Warriors are 8-2 in the Western Conference which is the #1 seed and are looking to be championship contenders again.

              <p class="kd">Most NBA players nearing 7 foot tall can't shoot the ball well. At 6' 11" Kevin Durant is one of the few exceptions. He can just shoot over anyone and with historic efficiency. Averaging <span class="span-1"> 27.6 points this year, over 50% from the floor this year, and 41% from 3</span> he is still one of if not the best shooters in the league and a complete 3 level scorer.</p>

            <p class="lebron">At almost 40 years old Lebron ages like wine. Like Durant, Lebron is a true 3 level scorer and elite playmaker that can drive into the paint with his size and speed being 6'9" 250lbs almost no one can stop him even at 39 years old. He also won <span class="span-1">Olympics MVP this year on a team with other people on this list.</span> The only things holding him back from being higher is that being <span class="span-2">almost 40 he gets noticably gassed out easily and that plays a part into his defense where he struggles to keep up at times.</span></p>

            <p class="shai">Shai was the <span class="span-1">runner up MVP last year and finished 7th in DPOY voting</span> which is an award dominated by centers. As a guard getting DPOY votes is very impressive. He does it all and at a high level. Will consistently get 30 points on phenomenal efficiency, he is a defensive force, a good passer. Just does everything very well. If he can take another step offensively this year he will be top 5 and maybe even top 3</p>

            <p class="ad">Anthony Davis finished <span class="span-1">4th in DPOY voting last year</span> and looks to have his 3pt shot back. <span class="span-1">When he's on the floor the floor the Lakers allow 116.9 point a game.</span> <span class="span-2">Without him they allow 126.3</span> which is by far the worst in the league. On top of being a great defender and a great rebounder, he's also a great offensive player averaging 24 points per game last year and over 30 this year having the best season of his career so far.</p>

                <p class="flop">I can't stand this guy too but he's one of the most dominant centers ever WHEN he plays. He missed half the season last year. How good is he? Since 2020 the #1 spot on this list has won MVP every year except for one year and that was Joel Embiid 2 years ago. <span class="span-1">Over the past 3 years hes averaged 30ppg, 33ppg, and 34ppg while being a DPOY canidate.</span></p>

                  <p class="giannis">The Greek Freak is almost impossible to guard. 6' 11" 242lbs with a 7'3" wingspan and a 40 inch verticle jump. If you made the perfect basketball player in a lab that would be him. <span class="span-1">6 straight years of making an AP1 selection.</span> That verticle jump combined with his long wingspan makes him the best dunker in the NBA. <span class="span-1">Averaging 61 fg% last year and 60% this year that's the efficiency of a center.</span> He's also a phenomenal defender and shot blocker.</p>

                  <p class="luka"><span class="span-1">Runner up in the NBA Finals.</span> At 6' 6" 230lbs he's a matchup nightmare for most other PGs since they are small compared to him. He's really slow but uses that to throw people off. He plays the game at his own pace and no one can top him. <span class="span-1">He won a scoring title last year averaging almost 34 a game on 48 fg%.</span> <span class="span-2">He's a complete cone on defense</span> but when scoring is that effortless it doesn't matter. He's also one of the best playmakers in the game.</p>

                  <p class="jokic">The fat Serbian is one of the best players to ever touch the ball. He's slow as molasses but incredibly strong. <span class="span-1">In the last 4 years he's won 3 MVPs.</span> He's the best rebounder in the league, best playmaker in the league and just straight up best playmaking center of all time, and he can give you 30pts a night on high efficency. He doesn't have all the accolades yet he's only 29 but he could finish his career as a top 5 player ever he's already an all time great. <span class="span-1">The gap from him to the 2nd best player in the league is huge.</span> He's just now entering his prime don't be surprised if he wins another 2+ MVPs and another ring. </p>
