    <h2>Without any specific order these are the players that didn't make the cut</h2>

    <h2>Jayson Tatum</h2>
    <img class="tatum" src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/HK7WO3XBDZHGIQCNU3UTZFCZEQ.jpg">
    <p>I cant stand this guy. He's a top 10 player but the Celtics suck. My list idc</p>

    <h2>Paolo Banchero</h2>
    <img class="paolo" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b1476c399dfff38173b8fbd1510c79ce7a24e7/0_0_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=e3118c3c7f13586f685d676687fe1711">
    <p>It's only his 3rd year in the league and hes averaging 29 a game. The closest thing we got to Blake Grifin. He could break the top 10 after this year.</p>

    <h2>Damian Lillard</h2>
    <img class="lillard" src="https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_1600,h_1600,q_95/v1709082091/olzfw48jsjmyoplk7via.jpg">
    <p>One of the greatest 3pt shooters of all time. He can shoot 3s from half court. Also a great playmaker.</p>

    <h2>Trae Young</h2>
    <img class="trae" src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/12/896/500/GettyImages-1245552227.jpg?ve=1&tl=1">
    <p>Walking highlight reel. Great scorer but efficency at times can be bad. Turns over the ball alot. Bad defender but what he brings on offense and his playmaking offsets it.</p>

    <h2>Jaylen Brunson</h2>
    <img class="brunson" src="https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63a3c27d8cc45940bdc9d574/NBA--DEC-16-Knicks-at-Bulls/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=960">
    <p>The Knicks rely on him to shoot 20+ times a game at times even going into the 30s and 40s and he does so with good efficency. Doesn't turn the ball over much. Out of everyone here he's probably the closest to cracking the top 10 he just doesn't bring enough on defense and his playmaking for a PG is average</p>

    <h2>Kyrie Irving</h2>
    <img class="kyrie" src="https://spogonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/408.jpg">
    <p>Kyrie is somewhere around top 15. He's unguardable at times and one of the best 2nd options in the league. Barely missed 50/40/90 club last season (50 fg%, 40 3pt% 90 free throw%)</p>

    <h2>Donovon Mitchell</h2>
    <img class="donovan" src="https://playmakerbrasil.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Donovan-Mitchell.jpg">
    <p>Donovan Mitchell also barely missed the list. The Cavaliers are the best team in the league and he's the #1 option on it. Made the all star game the past 5 years. True 3 level scorer and steps up in the playoffs.</p>

    <h2>Devin Booker</h2>
    <img class="devin" src="https://andscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2148630102-e1714070793812.jpg?w=800">
    <p>Great shooter. On a stacked olympic team he was ultra efficient when they needed him to make shots on a team with Lebron, Durant, Curry, etc. He's just a very good scorer. Has also made it to the NBA finals and his scoring efficeny rises in the playoffs</p>

    <h2>Domantas Sabonis</h2>
    <img class="sabonis" src="https://wallpapers.com/images/hd/domantas-sabonis-dunking-against-thomas-yve3eh19lwoeukwl.jpg">
    <p>In contention for the rebounding title every year. He's not a good shooter but he's incredibly strong easily one of the strongest players in the league and can dunk on anyone. He's the closest thing in the NBA to Shaq. He's also a good defensive player.</p>

    <h2>Victor Wembanyama</h2>
    <img class="victor" src="https://img.olympics.com/images/image/private/t_s_pog_staticContent_hero_xs_2x/f_auto/primary/hwyncbqeguz6xi9um4xz">
    <p>Last season he was a 19 year old rookie and was runner up in DPOY. He's 7'3" and plays like he's a foot shorter than he is. He can shoot 3s at a high % for a center. Only reason he's not top 10 is because he was a rookie last year. After this season he could be top 5</p>
